## Contributing

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Install the dependencies: `yarn`
3. Build the code, start the app, and watch for changes: `GOOGLE_MAPS=YOURKEY yarn run dev`

To make sure that your code works in the finished app, you can generate the binary using:

```
$ yarn run build
```

Make sure to include your google maps key in the `../components/Maps.js` file.

After that, you'll see the binaries in the `packed` folder.

## Todo

* Add more control features, ([suggest which one](https://github.com/geraldoramos/nikola/issues))
* Explore streaming api (currently polling data)
* Support multiple cars under same account
* Send address to car
* Notifications (battery low, charging stopped, and more)
